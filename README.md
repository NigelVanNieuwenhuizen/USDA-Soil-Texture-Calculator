# USDA-Soil-Texture-Calculator
A Python tool for automatically calculating USDA soil texture classes from soil components.

Users may specify either a delimited text file (either .txt or .csv) containing columns corresponding to soil components (percent soil, sand, and silt), choose an output format, and run the tool.

This tool is provided as an .exe file for windows users, and a .py script for all other platforms. When the application or script is run, a GUI will open to allow for entry of required parameters.

Please see the manual for more information on operating the tool.
